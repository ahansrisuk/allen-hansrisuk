## Wanna Quit All the Time - Faye Webster

[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3w3seawXfQGat9yH2B8Tge)

Light vocals and crispy percussive elements on a soft bed of warm, enveloping, low end. Everything the song needs and nothing it doesn't. 

## HiSense Touch

A new favorite of mine. The HiSense Touch is a phone-sized e-reader very similar to the Boox Palma. In recent months, I've been trying to be more intentional with my device usage. I mainly use it to read books loaded from my Calibre library and articles I've saved via [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/home).

## Hobonichi Techo

My main workhorse planner and journal since 2021. I've since migrated most of my stuff into Org Mode but each year I still like to pull out past journals and reflect. The page layout was the only one that I was able to consistently stick with for an extended amount of time. 

Favorite variations: Hobinichi Techo Cousin, Hobonichi Techo Cousin Avec.
